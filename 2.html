  <h2>Family</h2>
  <p>
  Praying is one of the most important things we can do for our family.
  Let's be real.
  No family is perfect.
  But, you know one thing I can 100% guarantee? Prayer WILL help.
  Does that mean your situation will be magically fixed?
  No.
  What it means is that in the process of praying, you increase your faith and surrender the fight to Jesus.
  Here are 5 Biblical truths about home and family you can pray for today:
  1. Pray to be a family united under the Godhead of the one true King Jesus Christ
  Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife,
  and they shall become one flesh (Genesis 2: 24 ESV).
  But if you refuse to serve the Lord, then choose today whom you will serve.
  Would you prefer the gods your ancestors served beyond the Euphrates?
  Or will it be the gods of the Amorites in whose land you now live?
  But as for me and my family,
  we will serve the Lord (Joshua 24: 15).
  Father, thank you for my family. Thank you
  for the laughter, the learning, the tears, and the triumphs that fill this home.
  It is my desire that my family would seek you, Lord. Jesus, I invite you into this house.
  Teach us. Root us in your word. We belong to you, God. May we honor you with our actions
  and our words. May we build each other up according to your principles. May we extend forgiveness when there is hurt.
  May we glorify you in our victories! In Jesus’ mighty name, Amen.
  2. Pray to be moms and dads who parent with Christ at the center of the home
  Direct your children onto the right path, and when they are older, they will not leave it (Proverbs 22: 6).
  And you must commit yourselves wholeheartedly to these commands that I am giving you today.
  Repeat them again and again to your children.
  Talk about them when you are at home and when you are on the road,
  when you are going to bed and when you are getting up. Tie them to your hands and wear them on your foreheads as reminders.
  Write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates (Deuteronomy 6: 6-9).
  Thank you, God, for the gift of motherhood. What a joy and a blessing my children are to me!
  But I cannot do it without you. Partner with me, Lord. Help me to lead with your example.
  Help me to speak your words of love, of kindness, of forgiveness, and correction. Holy Spirit, work through me when I don’t know what to do, when I don’t know what to say,
  when I don’t have the answers. Teach me to discipline my children and to set boundaries. Be my courage, Father, when the testing and the pushing comes. Be my fortress.
  I trust my parenting to you in the name of Jesus, Amen.
